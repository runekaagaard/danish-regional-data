Provides json and MySQL for danish "Regioner", "Kommuner" and "Postnumre". Also has some simple GEO information that allows for locating postal codes within a given distance of a postal code.

It does so by parsing a file given by Post Danmark into sql. The file is found here:
http://www.postdanmark.dk/cms/da-dk/files/Regionsopdelte_postnumre.pdf

If you just want the files you can get "danish\_regional\_data.json" and "danish\_regional\_data.sql" at http://code.google.com/p/danish-regional-data/source/browse/#svn/trunk.
